## Tech Stack
The project mainly focuses on the MERN stack:
1. **MongoDB** <br>
A Document based NoSQL database, which uses JSON type storage known as binary JSON (BSON).
2. **Express** <br>
A Node.js web framework which acts as a middleware for the function of creating robust APIs.
3. **ReactJS**<br>
ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript Library, used in the development of the front end of the web app.
4. **Nodejs**<br>
Node.js is a free, open-sourced JavaScript run-time environment that lets developers write command line tools and server-side scripts outside of a browser.

2. The react app has been hosted on port : 3000 and the server on port : 5000 of our localhost. 
```localhost:3000``` to access the react app

## Working with the React App

1. On accessing the `/` folder, We reach the login page, where we would have multiple logins and sign ups (according to access control).
